# set editing-mode vi

# Show mode indicator for vi mode
# set show-mode-in-prompt on

# Use case-insensitive tab completion
set completion-ignore-case on

# Treat hyphens and underscores as equivalent for completion
set completion-map-case on

# Show all completions immediately if ambiguous
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

# Don't require double tab for completion if there are multiple matches
set show-all-if-unmodified on

# Add trailing slash to directory names when completing
set mark-directories on
set mark-symlinked-directories on

# Don't autocomplete hidden files unless the pattern explicitly begins with a dot
set match-hidden-files off

# Show extra file information when completing (like ls -F)
set visible-stats on

# Use colors for completion (based on LS_COLORS)
set colored-stats on

# Be more intelligent about word boundaries when navigating

set convert-meta off

# Smart history search with arrow keys
# Type partial command and use up/down arrows to search history
"\e[A": history-search-backward
"\e[B": history-search-forward

# More intuitive keybindings
"\e[1;5C": forward-word      # Ctrl+Right: move forward one word
"\e[1;5D": backward-word     # Ctrl+Left: move backward one word
"\e[H": beginning-of-line    # Home: go to beginning of line
"\e[F": end-of-line          # End: go to end of line
"\e[3~": delete-char         # Delete: delete character under cursor

# Enable incremental history search
"\C-p": history-search-backward
"\C-n": history-search-forward

# Better tab completion behavior
TAB: menu-complete
"\e[Z": menu-complete-backward  # Shift+Tab: cycle backwards through completions

# Quick cd to parent directory
"\e\e": "cd ..\n"

# Paste from clipboard (works in some terminals)
# "\C-v": paste-from-clipboard
